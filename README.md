# Caribic
Software for the RC controlled boat "Caribic".

This Flask server is designed to control the Raspberry Pi 3B and all its components (GPS, gyroscope, engine, steering, ...) onboard by exposing frontend that a mobile or other device can connect to.
This can be achieved by turning on the AP on RPi.
